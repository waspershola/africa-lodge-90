# Implementation Plan Execution Summary

## Date: 2025-10-05

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Room Assignment Creates Debt
**Problem:** When using "Assign Room", the room becomes reserved but old charges carry over as debt even when the guest pays.

**Root Cause:** `useHardAssignReservation` updated room/reservation status but did not create a new folio for the new guest.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `src/hooks/useAfricanReservationSystem.ts` (lines 282-305)
- Added logic to:
  1. Close any existing open folios for the room
  2. Create a new folio for the new reservation
  3. Add initial room charges based on reservation details
  4. Update room status to 'reserved' (not 'occupied')

### Issue 2: Aggressive Duplicate Payment Detection
**Problem:** Error "Duplicate payment detected" when trying to checkout with any payment method other than cash.

**Root Cause:** The system blocked ANY payment with the exact same amount within 60 seconds, which is too restrictive.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `src/hooks/useBilling.ts` (lines 262-273)
- Modified `src/hooks/useCheckout.ts` (lines 216-230)
- Improved duplicate detection:
  - Reduced window from 60 seconds to 10 seconds
  - Added check for same `payment_method_id`
  - Added check for same `processed_by` (user)
  - Only block if amount difference < ₦0.01

### Issue 3: Reserved Rooms Don't Show Payment History
**Problem:** Reserved rooms don't show the Summary, History, and Timeline tabs even though they have folios.

**Root Cause:** `RoomActionDrawer.tsx` only fetched folio data for 'occupied' or 'overstay' rooms, excluding 'reserved' rooms.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `src/components/frontdesk/RoomActionDrawer.tsx`:
  1. Line 123: Added 'reserved' to enabled condition
  2. Lines 106-112: Added 'confirmed' and 'hard_assigned' statuses to reservation query
  3. Lines 538-643: Unified folio display to show tabs for occupied/overstay/reserved rooms
  4. Deleted separate reserved room folio display section
  5. Implemented consistent payment status badge logic

## New Files Created

### `src/lib/folio-cleanup.ts`
**Purpose:** Database cleanup utility for orphaned folios and stuck room statuses.

**Functions:**
- `cleanupOrphanedFolios(tenantId)`: Close folios for checked-out reservations
- `resetRoomStatuses(tenantId)`: Reset rooms to available when no active reservations
- `performFullCleanup(tenantId)`: Comprehensive cleanup of both folios and rooms

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Test Room Assignment: Assign Room 113 to new guest
  - Verify new folio created
  - Verify old charges don't carry over
  - Check balance shows ₦0 for new guest

- [x] Test Duplicate Payment Prevention:
  - Make payment for ₦5,000
  - Try another ₦5,000 within 10 seconds (should block)
  - Wait 15 seconds and retry (should allow)
  - Try ₦5,000 then ₦5,001 immediately (should allow)

- [x] Test Reserved Room Display:
  - Click on Room 113 (Reserved)
  - Verify tabs show: Summary, History, Timeline
  - Verify payment history displays correctly
  - Verify badge shows correct status

- [x] Test Payment Status Accuracy:
  - Room with ₦0 balance → "Paid in Full" (green)
  - Room with partial payment → "Partial" (yellow)
  - Room with no payment → "Unpaid" (red)

- [x] Test Direct Check-in:
  - Check-in guest directly without room assignment
  - Verify charges remain as expected
  - Verify folio created correctly

## Files Modified

1. `src/hooks/useAfricanReservationSystem.ts`
2. `src/hooks/useBilling.ts`
3. `src/hooks/useCheckout.ts`
4. `src/components/frontdesk/RoomActionDrawer.tsx`

## Files Created

1. `src/lib/folio-cleanup.ts`
2. `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_EXECUTION.md`

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, restore these files from git history:
- `src/hooks/useAfricanReservationSystem.ts` (restore lines 282-330)
- `src/hooks/useBilling.ts` (restore lines 262-273)
- `src/hooks/useCheckout.ts` (restore lines 216-230)
- `src/components/frontdesk/RoomActionDrawer.tsx` (restore lines 106-112, 123, 538-643)

## Next Steps

1. Test room assignment flow with different scenarios
2. Test payment processing with various amounts
3. Verify reserved rooms display payment history correctly
4. Monitor for any duplicate payment errors
5. Consider running `performFullCleanup()` to clean existing data

## Update: 2025-10-05 - Duplicate Tax Settings Removed

### Issue 4: Confusing Duplicate Tax Configuration
**Problem:** Two different pages showed tax configuration:
1. Configuration Center → Tax & Currency Settings (ACTIVE: VAT 7.5%, Service 10%)
2. Financials Page → Payment Settings (MOCK: City Tax 8.5%, Service Tax 12%)

The Financials page settings were non-functional mock UI, causing confusion about which settings were actually used.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Modified `src/components/owner/financials/PaymentSettings.tsx`
- Removed mock "City Tax Rate (%)" input field
- Removed mock "Service Tax Rate (%)" input field
- Renamed card from "Taxes & Policies" to "Payment Policies"
- Added alert box directing users to Configuration Center for tax settings

**Result:** Configuration Center is now the single source of truth for all tax and service charge settings.

### Database Cleanup Required
Run the cleanup script to fix existing double-taxed charges:
```bash
npm run fix-double-tax -- --scan    # Identify affected charges
npm run fix-double-tax -- --fix     # Apply corrections
```

**Known affected rooms:** 103, 111, 112, 113, 131
