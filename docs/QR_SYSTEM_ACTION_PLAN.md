## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Priority 1: Fix Room 103 (CRITICAL - 5 minutes)

**Issue:** Room 103 has no active QR code after duplicate cleanup

**SQL Fix:**
```sql
-- Reactivate the kept QR code for Room 103
UPDATE qr_codes 
SET is_active = true, expires_at = NULL, updated_at = now()
WHERE id = 'f88d9ab5-0c96-4b54-9f55-c7847cafab91';

-- Log the manual fix
INSERT INTO audit_log (tenant_id, action, resource_type, resource_id, metadata)
SELECT 
  tenant_id,
  'qr_manual_reactivation_after_cleanup',
  'qr_code',
  id,
  jsonb_build_object(
    'reason', 'Room left without active QR after duplicate cleanup',
    'room_id', room_id,
    'manual_fix', true
  )
FROM qr_codes
WHERE id = 'f88d9ab5-0c96-4b54-9f55-c7847cafab91';
```

**Expected Result:**
- Room 103 QR code becomes active
- Guests can submit requests immediately
- Audit log contains fix entry

---

### Priority 2: Verify Room Status (OPTIONAL - 10 minutes)

**Check if rooms 111/114 have active reservations:**

```sql
-- Verify room reservation status
SELECT 
  r.room_number,
  r.id as room_id,
  qr.id as qr_id,
  qr.is_active as qr_active,
  qr.expires_at as qr_expiry,
  res.id as reservation_id,
  res.status as reservation_status,
  res.check_in_date,
  res.check_out_date,
  res.guest_name
FROM rooms r
LEFT JOIN qr_codes qr ON qr.room_id = r.id
LEFT JOIN reservations res ON res.room_id = r.id 
  AND res.status IN ('checked_in', 'confirmed', 'reserved')
WHERE r.room_number IN ('111', '114')
ORDER BY r.room_number;
```

**Decision Matrix:**
- **If rooms have active reservations:** Leave as-is (will be managed on checkout)
- **If rooms are vacant:** Set expiration or deactivate QR codes
- **If uncertain:** Wait for auto-reactivation trigger to manage

---

### Priority 3: Test Auto-Reactivation (RECOMMENDED - 15 minutes)

**Test Scenario:**

1. **Find a test reservation:**
```sql
SELECT id, room_id, status, guest_name
FROM reservations
WHERE status IN ('reserved', 'confirmed')
LIMIT 1;
```

2. **Simulate check-in:**
```sql
UPDATE reservations
SET status = 'checked_in'
WHERE id = '[reservation_id]';
```

3. **Verify QR reactivation:**
```sql
SELECT 
  qr.id,
  qr.is_active,
  qr.expires_at,
  qr.updated_at
FROM qr_codes qr
WHERE qr.room_id = '[room_id]';
```

4. **Check audit log:**
```sql
SELECT 
  action,
  metadata->>'room_id' as room_id,
  metadata->>'guest_name' as guest_name,
  created_at
FROM audit_log
WHERE action = 'qr_reactivated_on_checkin'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ QR code `is_active` = true
- ✅ QR code `expires_at` = NULL
- ✅ Audit log entry created
- ✅ Updated timestamp is recent

**If test fails:**
- Check trigger exists: `SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'auto_reactivate_qr_on_checkin_trigger'`
- Check function exists: `SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'auto_reactivate_qr_on_checkin'`
- Review postgres logs for errors
- Verify reservation status change was committed

## 📊 COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PLAN

### Test Suite 1: QR Lifecycle (30 minutes)

**Test 1.1: Check-in Auto-Reactivation**
- [ ] Create test reservation (status: 'confirmed')
- [ ] QR code should be inactive or expired
- [ ] Update reservation status to 'checked_in'
- [ ] Verify QR code becomes active
- [ ] Verify expires_at is NULL
- [ ] Check audit log entry

**Test 1.2: Checkout Grace Period**
- [ ] Use Room 111 or 114 (active reservation)
- [ ] Update reservation status to 'checked_out'
- [ ] Verify QR code remains active
- [ ] Verify expires_at = checkout_date + 24 hours
- [ ] Wait 2 minutes (simulate time passing)
- [ ] Verify QR still active within grace period

**Test 1.3: Manual Toggle Controls**
- [ ] Navigate to QR Directory (Front Desk)
- [ ] Find any active QR code
- [ ] Click "Deactivate" button
- [ ] Verify toast notification
- [ ] Verify QR code status changes to inactive
- [ ] Click "Activate" button
- [ ] Verify reactivation works

**Test 1.4: Duplicate Prevention**
- [ ] Try to create a second QR code for Room 111
- [ ] Attempt to activate it
- [ ] Should fail with constraint error
- [ ] Only one active QR per room allowed

---

### Test Suite 2: Notification Flow (20 minutes)

**Test 2.1: Guest Request Submission**
- [ ] Scan a valid QR code (e.g., Lobby or Room 111)
- [ ] Submit a service request
- [ ] Verify request appears in guest history
- [ ] Verify request tracking number displayed
- [ ] Verify session stored in localStorage

**Test 2.2: Front Desk Notification**
- [ ] Front desk user logged in
- [ ] Guest submits request (from Test 2.1)
- [ ] Notification should appear within 2 seconds
- [ ] Toast notification visible
- [ ] Sound plays (Thai bell)
- [ ] Request visible in QR Requests Panel

**Test 2.3: Status Updates**
- [ ] Front desk user updates request status
- [ ] Guest should see update in real-time
- [ ] Test multiple status changes
- [ ] Verify timestamps update correctly

---

### Test Suite 3: Session Management (15 minutes)

**Test 3.1: Session Persistence**
- [ ] Guest scans QR code
- [ ] Submit a request
- [ ] Close browser completely
- [ ] Reopen browser
- [ ] Navigate to resume link
- [ ] Verify requests still visible
- [ ] Verify session token in localStorage

**Test 3.2: Session Expiry**
- [ ] Use a QR code with expired session (if available)
- [ ] Try to view request history
- [ ] Should show "Session Expired" message
- [ ] Should prompt to scan QR again

**Test 3.3: Multiple Sessions**
- [ ] Scan QR code in Browser 1
- [ ] Scan different QR code in Browser 2
- [ ] Submit requests from both
- [ ] Verify no cross-contamination
- [ ] Each session shows only its requests

## 📞 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Auto-Reactivation Doesn't Work:
1. Check trigger exists
2. Review postgres logs
3. Verify reservation status change
4. Check audit log for errors
5. Manual fallback: Use toggle controls

### If Duplicates Appear:
1. Shouldn't happen (constraint prevents)
2. If it does, run cleanup function
3. Check constraint is active
4. Review how duplicates were created

### If Room 103 Still Has Issues:
1. Verify fix was applied
2. Check current QR status
3. Try check-in/checkout cycle
4. Manual reactivation as fallback

---

**RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Apply Room 103 fix, then deploy to production with monitoring plan in place.

**NEXT REVIEW:** 24 hours after deployment
