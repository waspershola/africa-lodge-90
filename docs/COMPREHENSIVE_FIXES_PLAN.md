# Comprehensive System Fixes Plan
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

---

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates all outstanding issues across the hotel management system and provides a prioritized action plan for completion. It builds upon the completed QR System Fixes and addresses remaining security, database, and architecture concerns.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### Phase 1-3: QR System Improvements (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Enhanced edge function logging with request tracking
- ✅ Created comprehensive debug panel for staff monitoring
- ✅ Fixed 4 database functions with `SET search_path TO 'public'`
- ✅ Reduced security warnings from 7 to 6
- **Reference:** `docs/QR_SYSTEM_FIXES_COMPLETE.md`

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### 1. **Public Guest Portal Exposure** ⚠️ ERROR LEVEL
**Status:** CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY  
**Impact:** Guest QR sessions can be enumerated and accessed without authorization

**Problem:**
```sql
-- Current policy in short_urls table:
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for all users" 
ON short_urls FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

**Risk:**
- Attackers can enumerate all active guest sessions
- Access guest portals without scanning QR codes
- Bypass device fingerprint validation
- Impersonate guests

**Solution:**
- Remove public SELECT policy
- Implement secure lookup function that only validates short codes
- Add rate limiting to prevent enumeration
- Enhance device fingerprint validation

**Priority:** 🔥 IMMEDIATE (Day 1)

---

### 2. **Function Search Path Vulnerabilities** ⚠️ 5 Functions Remaining
**Status:** SECURITY WARNING  
**Impact:** Functions vulnerable to schema injection attacks

**Current State:**
- Database linter shows 5 functions still missing `SET search_path TO 'public'`
- Previous migration applied fix to 4 functions
- Remaining functions need identification and fixing

**Solution:**
- Query all public functions
- Identify which 5 are missing the security setting
- Apply `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` with `SET search_path TO 'public'`
- Re-run linter to verify

**Priority:** 🔥 HIGH (Day 1-2)

---

### 3. **SMS Templates Publicly Readable** ⚠️ WARN LEVEL
**Status:** SECURITY WARNING  
**Impact:** Communication patterns exposed, phishing risk

**Problem:**
```sql
-- sms_templates table has public SELECT access
-- Reveals: booking confirmations, payment reminders, notification patterns
```

**Risk:**
- Competitors can copy messaging strategy
- Attackers can craft convincing phishing messages
- Customer communication patterns exposed

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Restrict to authenticated tenant users only
CREATE POLICY "Tenant users can read own SMS templates"
ON sms_templates FOR SELECT
USING (
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM profiles 
    WHERE tenant_id = sms_templates.tenant_id
  )
);
```

**Priority:** 🔥 HIGH (Day 2)

---

## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Fix Within Week 1)

### 4. **Leaked Password Protection Disabled**
**Status:** AUTH CONFIGURATION  
**Impact:** Users can set weak/compromised passwords

**Problem:**
- Supabase Auth setting is disabled
- Users can register with passwords from data breaches
- No password strength enforcement beyond basic requirements

**Solution:**
- Enable in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Providers → Email
- Configure minimum password strength score
- Implement password breach detection

**Priority:** HIGH (Day 3)  
**Action Required:** Manual configuration in Supabase dashboard

---

### 5. **Demo Config & Sounds Tables Publicly Readable** ℹ️ INFO LEVEL
**Status:** LOW SECURITY RISK  
**Impact:** Unnecessary exposure of internal configuration

**Tables Affected:**
- `demo_config` - Marketing video URLs and promotional text
- `sounds` - Notification sound file paths

**Risk:**
- Low impact but unnecessary exposure
- Reveals internal system configuration
- Could aid reconnaissance attacks

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Restrict to authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read demo config"
ON demo_config FOR SELECT
USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read sounds"
ON sounds FOR SELECT
USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Day 4-5)

---

## 📊 BROADER SYSTEM ISSUES (From Codebase Reviews)

### 6. **Duplicate Authentication Systems** 
**Status:** ARCHITECTURAL TECHNICAL DEBT  
**Impact:** Code maintenance, potential bugs

**Problem:**
- Two auth hooks exist:
  - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` (legacy)
  - `src/hooks/useMultiTenantAuth.ts` (current)
- Mixed usage across 15+ components
- Inconsistent authentication patterns

**Solution:**
- Audit all components using `useAuth`
- Migrate to single `useMultiTenantAuth`
- Remove legacy hook
- Update all imports

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Week 2)  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

---

### 7. **Mock Data Dependencies**
**Status:** PRODUCTION BLOCKER  
**Impact:** Cannot deploy without backend

**Scope:**
- 95% of data operations use localStorage
- Mock adapters throughout codebase
- No real Supabase integration in most modules

**Solution:**
- Replace mock data with Supabase queries
- Implement real-time subscriptions
- Remove localStorage dependencies
- Test with real data

**Priority:** MEDIUM (Week 2-3)  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks

---

### 8. **Security - Token Storage in localStorage**
**Status:** SECURITY VULNERABILITY  
**Impact:** XSS token theft possible

**Problem:**
```typescript
// In useMultiTenantAuth.ts and useTrialStatus.ts
localStorage.setItem('auth_token', token);
```

**Risk:**
- Tokens vulnerable to XSS attacks
- No httpOnly protection
- Session hijacking possible

**Solution:**
- Use Supabase Auth session management
- Rely on httpOnly cookies
- Remove manual token storage
- Implement proper session handling

**Priority:** HIGH (Week 1)  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days
