## ⚠️ Critical Findings

### 1. **17 Remaining Polling Intervals** (HIGH PRIORITY)

These hooks are still polling unnecessarily:

#### Dashboard Data Hooks (6 files)
1. `src/hooks/data/useFrontDeskData.ts` - 2 intervals (30s, 60s)
2. `src/hooks/data/useReservationsData.ts` - 2 intervals (5min, 5min)
3. `src/hooks/useDashboardAlerts.ts` - 1 interval (60s)
4. `src/hooks/useDashboardTasks.ts` - 1 interval (60s)
5. `src/hooks/useTodayArrivals.ts` - 1 interval (30s)
6. `src/hooks/useTodayDepartures.ts` - 1 interval (30s)

#### Analytics/Monitoring (5 files)
7. `src/components/admin/BackgroundJobsMonitor.tsx` - 30s
8. `src/components/hotel/sms/HotelSMSUsage.tsx` - 30s
9. `src/components/owner/qr/UnifiedAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - 30s
10. `src/hooks/useApi.ts` - 30s (dashboard metrics)
11. `src/pages/manager/QRDebugPanel.tsx` - 10s

#### Operational Monitoring (5 files)
12. `src/hooks/useOverstayDetection.ts` - 5min
13. `src/hooks/useOverstays.ts` - 30s
14. `src/hooks/usePendingPayments.ts` - 60s
15. `src/hooks/useShiftIntegrationStatus.ts` - 30s
16. `src/hooks/useFuelLevel.ts` - 5min

#### Session Management (1 file)
17. `src/pages/SessionManagement.tsx` - 30s

**Impact**: These 17 intervals are still causing:
- ~34 network requests per minute (assuming average 30s intervals)
- Unnecessary server load
- Battery drain on mobile devices
- Memory accumulation over time

---

## 🎯 Remaining Work Plan

### Phase 8: Remove Remaining Polling Intervals

#### **8A: Dashboard Data Hooks** (Priority: HIGH)
**Rationale**: These are frequently used, heavily impact frontdesk performance

Files to update:
- `src/hooks/data/useFrontDeskData.ts` (2 queries)
- `src/hooks/data/useReservationsData.ts` (2 queries)
- `src/hooks/useTodayArrivals.ts`
- `src/hooks/useTodayDepartures.ts`
- `src/hooks/useDashboardAlerts.ts`
- `src/hooks/useDashboardTasks.ts`

**Action**: Remove all `refetchInterval` - rely on `useUnifiedRealtime()` invalidations

---

#### **8B: Analytics/Monitoring Components** (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Rationale**: These need polling for non-real-time data (aggregates, statistics)

**Decision Required**: 
- **Background Jobs Monitor**: Keep polling (admin-only, not real-time data)
- **SMS Usage**: Keep polling (statistics, not real-time critical)
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Keep polling (aggregated data)
- **QR Debug Panel**: Remove (dev tool, should use real-time)

Files to update:
- `src/pages/manager/QRDebugPanel.tsx` - **REMOVE** (dev tool)

Files to keep:
- `src/components/admin/BackgroundJobsMonitor.tsx` - Keep (admin stats)
- `src/components/hotel/sms/HotelSMSUsage.tsx` - Keep (statistics)
- `src/components/owner/qr/UnifiedAnalyticsDashboard.tsx` - Keep (analytics)
- `src/hooks/useApi.ts` - Keep (dashboard metrics)

---

#### **8C: Operational Monitoring** (Priority: MEDIUM-LOW)
**Rationale**: These monitor operational states that change infrequently

**Recommendation**: Increase intervals to reduce overhead

Files to update:
- `src/hooks/useOverstayDetection.ts` - Change 5min → 10min
- `src/hooks/useOverstays.ts` - Change 30s → 2min (rely on real-time)
- `src/hooks/usePendingPayments.ts` - Change 60s → 5min
- `src/hooks/useShiftIntegrationStatus.ts` - Change 30s → 2min
- `src/hooks/useFuelLevel.ts` - Keep 5min (slow-changing data)

---

#### **8D: Session Management** (Priority: LOW)
**Rationale**: Session changes are admin-facing, not performance-critical

File to update:
- `src/pages/SessionManagement.tsx` - Change 30s → 60s or remove

---

### Phase 9: Remove Deprecated Hooks

**Files to delete**:
1. `src/hooks/useFrontDeskRealtimeUpdates.ts` (not used anywhere)
2. `src/hooks/useTenantRealtime.ts` (not used anywhere)

**Verification**:
- Already confirmed no active usage
- Safe to delete immediately
