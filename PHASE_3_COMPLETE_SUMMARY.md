## 🚨 Important Notes

### Before Manual Testing:
1. ✅ Run automated verification (should all PASS)
2. ✅ Review and export automated test report
3. ✅ Ensure you have access to 3 canary tenant accounts
4. ✅ Prepare 2 devices/browsers for concurrent testing
5. ✅ Have browser DevTools ready for performance measurement

### During Manual Testing:
- Document every test execution
- Take screenshots of issues
- Copy console logs for errors
- Record performance metrics
- Note any unexpected behavior

### After Manual Testing:
- Export verification report
- Document all test results
- Share report with team
- Decision: Proceed to Phase 4 or remediate issues

---

## 🎯 Phase 4 Preview: Canary Deployment

**Only proceed if:**
- ✅ All automated tests PASS
- ✅ All manual tests PASS
- ✅ No critical issues found
- ✅ Performance targets met
- ✅ Team approval obtained

**Canary Deployment Steps:**
1. Enable ONE feature flag for ONE canary tenant
2. Monitor for 48-72 hours
3. Run smoke tests on canary tenant
4. Review metrics and errors
5. If successful, expand to remaining canary tenants
6. If issues found, rollback immediately

---

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure

### Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```sql
-- Disable all feature flags immediately
UPDATE feature_flags 
SET is_enabled = false, updated_at = now()
WHERE flag_name LIKE 'ff/%';
```

### Verify Rollback
```sql
SELECT flag_name, is_enabled 
FROM feature_flags 
WHERE flag_name LIKE 'ff/%';
```
