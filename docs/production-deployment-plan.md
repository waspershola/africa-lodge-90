# Production Deployment Plan
## Hotel Management System - Launch Ready Strategy

### Current Status
- **Frontend/UI**: 100% Production Ready ✅
- **Backend/Database**: 85% Ready (Schema gaps, RLS hardening needed) ⚠️
- **Target**: Close 15% gap for immediate production launch

---

## Phase 1: Critical Backend Fixes (3-5 days)
*Priority: BLOCKER - Must complete before launch*

### 1.1 Database Schema Completion
- [ ] **Tenant Isolation Audit**
  - Verify all core tables have `tenant_id` columns
  - Ensure RLS policies reference `auth.jwt()->>'tenant_id'`
  - Test cross-tenant data isolation

- [ ] **Missing Tables Creation**
  ```sql
  - hotel_settings (tenant configs)
  - branding_assets (logos, receipts)
  - documents (templates, storage refs)
  - currency_settings (financial configs)
  - power_logs, fuel_logs, utility_costs
  - financial_transactions, debt_tracking
  ```

### 1.2 Performance Indexes
- [ ] **Critical Indexes**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_reservations_tenant_dates ON reservations(tenant_id, check_in_date, check_out_date, status);
  CREATE INDEX idx_payments_tenant_created ON payments(tenant_id, created_at);
  CREATE INDEX idx_folio_charges_folio_posted ON folio_charges(folio_id, created_at);
  CREATE INDEX idx_housekeeping_tasks_tenant_status ON housekeeping_tasks(tenant_id, status, assigned_to);
  ```

### 1.3 Essential Functions & Triggers
- [ ] **Revenue Functions**
  ```sql
  - fn_adr(tenant_id, start_date, end_date)
  - fn_revpar(tenant_id, start_date, end_date)  
  - fn_daily_revenue(tenant_id, date_range)
  ```

- [ ] **Booking Functions**
  ```sql
  - fn_check_availability(tenant_id, room_type, dates)
  - create_reservation_atomic(guest_data, reservation_data)
  ```

- [ ] **Auto-Update Triggers**
  ```sql
  - update_folio_balance_on_payment()
  - update_room_availability_on_reservation()
  - audit_log_config_changes()
  ```

---

## Phase 2: Security Hardening (2-3 days)
*Priority: HIGH - Security audit before launch*

### 2.1 RLS Policy Audit
- [ ] **Systematic RLS Review**
  - Every table: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies
  - Test with different roles: Owner, Manager, Staff
  - Verify no cross-tenant data leakage

### 2.2 Staff Authentication Flow
- [ ] **Complete Staff Invite System**
  - Owner invites → `auth.users` insert with `tenant_id`
  - Temporary password generation + email
  - Force password reset on first login
  - Password reset workflow

### 2.3 Role-Based Permissions
- [ ] **Permission Matrix Implementation**
  - Owner: Full tenant control
  - Manager: Operations (reservations, housekeeping, reports)
  - Front Desk: Check-in/out, payments, guest management
  - Housekeeping: Tasks, room status, supplies
  - Maintenance: Work orders, asset management

---

## Phase 3: Reports & Analytics (1-2 days)
*Priority: MEDIUM - Core business intelligence*

### 3.1 Materialized Views
- [ ] **Create Performance Views**
  ```sql
  - mv_daily_revenue_by_tenant
  - mv_occupancy_daily  
  - mv_guest_stats_monthly
  - folio_balances (real-time view)
  ```

### 3.2 Automated Refresh
- [ ] **Supabase Cron Jobs**
  - Daily refresh at 2 AM local time
  - Revenue aggregation updates
  - Occupancy calculations

---

## Phase 4: Final Testing & Launch (2-3 days)
*Priority: CRITICAL - Launch validation*

### 4.1 Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] **Multi-Tenant Testing**
  - Create 2 test hotels
  - Verify complete data isolation
  - Cross-role permission testing

- [ ] **End-to-End Workflows**
  - Guest booking → folio → payment → checkout
  - Staff invite → login → role verification
  - QR order → staff assignment → completion
  - Configuration changes → audit logging

### 4.2 Performance Validation
- [ ] **Load Testing**
  - 1000 concurrent users
  - API response < 500ms
  - Database query optimization

### 4.3 Mobile & Responsive QA
- [ ] **Device Testing**
  - All 12 dashboard sections mobile-optimized
  - Touch interactions functional
  - Performance on mobile devices

---

## Phase 5: Production Deployment (1 day)
*Priority: EXECUTION - Go-live*

### 5.1 Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] **Environment Setup**
  - Production Supabase project configured
  - Custom domain SSL certificates
  - Environment variables secured
  - Backup procedures established

### 5.2 Launch Execution
- [ ] **Deployment Steps**
  1. Database migration execution
  2. Frontend deployment to production
  3. DNS cutover to custom domain
  4. SSL certificate validation
  5. Production monitoring activation

### 5.3 Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] **24-Hour Watch**
  - Error rate monitoring
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - User feedback collection
  - Support ticket system ready

---

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All 12 modules fully functional with real data
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation verified (0% data leakage)
- ✅ Staff authentication & permissions working
- ✅ Revenue calculations accurate (ADR, RevPAR)
- ✅ Mobile responsive across all features
- ✅ API performance <500ms average response time
- ✅ Zero critical security vulnerabilities

---

## Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback Plan**: Staged deployment with blue-green setup
- **Data Backup**: Automated daily backups before launch
- **Support Coverage**: 24/7 support for first week post-launch
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for system issues

---

**Estimated Timeline: 9-13 days to production launch**
**Team Required: 1-2 full-stack developers, 1 DevOps engineer**
