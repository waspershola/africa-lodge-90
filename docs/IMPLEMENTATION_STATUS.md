- [ ] Payment verification workflow for staff
- [ ] Receipt generation

**Business Decision Needed:**

- [x] Analytics dashboard (`/owner/qr-analytics`)
- [x] Real-time request updates via `useUnifiedRealtime`

**Missing:**
- [ ] Dedicated staff dashboard for active QR requests
- [ ] Request assignment UI
- [ ] Bulk actions (assign, complete, cancel)
- [ ] Live guest messaging interface

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

---

#### 4. Production Rollout Documentation (NOT STARTED)
**Missing:**
- [ ] Environment setup checklist
- [ ] Feature flag configuration guide

- Request completion time (staff response)
- Guest satisfaction (feedback scores)

### Business Impact
- QR scans/day
- Active requests/day
- Most popular services
- Peak usage hours

---

## ðŸ”¥ BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Current Blockers
1. **Payment Feature Decision** - Needs product owner approval
2. **Test Environment Access** - Need real devices for camera testing

### Risks
1. **Camera Compatibility** - Some older devices may not support file input
   - **Mitigation:** Manual token entry fallback
   
2. **Offline Sync Reliability** - Network flakiness in African contexts
   - **Mitigation:** IndexedDB persistence + retry logic

3. **Rate Limiting False Positives** - Shared IP addresses (hotel WiFi)
   - **Mitigation:** Session-based throttling as primary, IP as secondary

---

## ðŸ’¡ RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Immediate Implementation
1. **Complete E2E Tests** - Critical for production confidence
2. **Add Error Monitoring** - Integrate Sentry for edge function errors
3. **Create Rollout Checklist** - Ensure smooth deployment

### For Future Consideration
1. **Redis Rate Limiting** - Replace in-memory with Upstash Redis
2. **Payment Gateway** - Integrate with Paystack/Flutterwave
3. **Multi-language Support** - I18n for guest portal
4. **Push Notifications** - Web Push for request updates
