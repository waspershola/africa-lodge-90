## ⚙️ Helper Functions Created

### **1. `get_default_department(p_tenant_id uuid)`**
Returns the default 'FRONTDESK' department ID for a tenant.

**Usage:**
```sql
SELECT get_default_department('tenant-uuid');
```

### **2. `get_default_terminal(p_tenant_id uuid, p_department_id uuid)`**
Returns the default terminal for a tenant/department.

**Usage:**
```sql
SELECT get_default_terminal('tenant-uuid', 'dept-uuid');
SELECT get_default_terminal('tenant-uuid', NULL); -- Any department
```

---

## 🔄 Audit & Triggers

### **1. Updated Timestamp Triggers**
- `trigger_update_departments_updated_at` on `departments`
- `trigger_update_terminals_updated_at` on `terminals`

### **2. Payment Verification Audit**
- `trigger_audit_payment_verification` on `payments`
- Logs every payment verification to `audit_log` table
- Captures: payment_id, amount, method, department, terminal, status

**Audit Log Entry Example:**
```json
{
  "action": "PAYMENT_VERIFIED",
  "resource_type": "PAYMENT",
  "actor_id": "user-uuid",
  "metadata": {
    "payment_id": "payment-uuid",
    "amount": 35250.00,
    "payment_method_id": "method-uuid",
    "department_id": "dept-uuid",
    "terminal_id": "terminal-uuid",
    "payment_status": "paid"
  }
}
```

---

## 💻 Code Updates

### **Payment Processor Enhancements**

**File:** `src/lib/payment-processor.ts`

#### **Updated Interface:**
```typescript
export interface ProcessPaymentParams {
  folioId: string;
  grossAmount: number;
  paymentMethodId: string;
  tenantId: string;
  userId?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  // Phase 2: New fields
  departmentId?: string;
  terminalId?: string;
  paymentSource?: 'frontdesk' | 'restaurant' | 'bar' | 'gym' | 'spa' | 'laundry' | 'other';
}
```

#### **Auto-Verification Logic:**
```typescript
// Auto-verified methods (instant settlement)
const AUTO_VERIFIED_METHODS = ['pos', 'bank_transfer', 'card', 'mobile_money'];

// Manual verification methods
const MANUAL_VERIFICATION = ['cash'];

// Pay later (no verification needed)
const PAY_LATER = ['credit', 'bill_to_company'];

// Pending methods (requires clearing)
const PENDING_METHODS = ['cheque'];
```

#### **Payment Status Determination:**
```typescript
const shouldAutoVerify = AUTO_VERIFIED_METHODS.includes(method.type);
const paymentStatus = PAY_LATER.includes(method.type) 
  ? 'unpaid' 
  : (method.type === 'cheque' ? 'pending' : 'paid');
const isVerified = shouldAutoVerify;
```

#### **Default Department/Terminal Assignment:**
```typescript
// If no department specified, get default
if (!departmentId) {
  const { data: defaultDept } = await supabase.rpc('get_default_department', {
    p_tenant_id: tenantId
  });
  finalDepartmentId = defaultDept || undefined;
}

// If no terminal specified, get default for department
if (!terminalId && departmentId) {
  const { data: defaultTerminal } = await supabase.rpc('get_default_terminal', {
    p_tenant_id: tenantId,
    p_department_id: departmentId
  });
  finalTerminalId = defaultTerminal || undefined;
}
```

## 📈 New Reporting Capabilities

With Phase 2 schema, you can now generate:

### **1. Payments by Department**
```sql
SELECT 
  d.name as department,
  COUNT(p.id) as transaction_count,
  SUM(p.gross_amount) as gross_revenue,
  SUM(p.fee_amount) as total_fees,
  SUM(p.net_amount) as net_revenue
FROM payments p
JOIN departments d ON d.id = p.department_id
WHERE p.tenant_id = 'tenant-uuid'
  AND p.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY d.name
ORDER BY net_revenue DESC;
```

### **2. Payments by Terminal (Cashier Reconciliation)**
```sql
SELECT 
  t.terminal_name,
  t.location,
  u.name as cashier,
  COUNT(p.id) as transactions,
  SUM(p.gross_amount) as gross_total,
  SUM(p.fee_amount) as fees_total,
  SUM(p.net_amount) as net_total
FROM payments p
JOIN terminals t ON t.id = p.terminal_id
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = p.processed_by
WHERE p.tenant_id = 'tenant-uuid'
  AND DATE(p.created_at) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY t.terminal_name, t.location, u.name
ORDER BY transactions DESC;
```

### **3. Unverified Payments Report**
```sql
SELECT 
  p.id,
  p.created_at,
  p.gross_amount,
  pm.name as payment_method,
  d.name as department,
  t.terminal_name,
  p.payment_status
FROM payments p
JOIN payment_methods pm ON pm.id = p.payment_method_id
LEFT JOIN departments d ON d.id = p.department_id
LEFT JOIN terminals t ON t.id = p.terminal_id
WHERE p.tenant_id = 'tenant-uuid'
  AND p.is_verified = false
  AND p.payment_status = 'paid'
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

### **4. Payment Status Summary**
```sql
SELECT 
  payment_status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(gross_amount) as total_gross,
  SUM(net_amount) as total_net
FROM payments
WHERE tenant_id = 'tenant-uuid'
  AND created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY payment_status;
```

### **5. Staff Verification Audit**
```sql
SELECT 
  u.name as verifier,
  COUNT(p.id) as verifications,
  SUM(p.gross_amount) as total_verified,
  MIN(p.verified_at) as first_verification,
  MAX(p.verified_at) as last_verification
FROM payments p
JOIN users u ON u.id = p.verified_by
WHERE p.tenant_id = 'tenant-uuid'
  AND p.is_verified = true
  AND p.verified_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY u.name
ORDER BY verifications DESC;
```

## ✅ Verification Workflow

### **Auto-Verified Payments:**
```
User initiates payment
  ↓
Payment processor determines method type
  ↓
Method type = 'pos', 'bank_transfer', 'card', 'mobile_money'
  ↓
Payment created with:
  - is_verified = true
  - verified_by = processed_by (user who initiated)
  - verified_at = now()
  - payment_status = 'paid'
  ↓
Audit log entry created
  ↓
Payment complete
```

### **Manual Verification Payments (Cash):**
```
User initiates cash payment
  ↓
Payment created with:
  - is_verified = false
  - verified_by = NULL
  - verified_at = NULL
  - payment_status = 'paid'
  ↓
Manager reviews unverified payments
  ↓
Manager verifies payment
  ↓
Payment updated:
  - is_verified = true
  - verified_by = manager_id
  - verified_at = now()
  ↓
Audit log entry created
```

### **Pay Later (Credit/Debt):**
```
User creates credit payment
  ↓
Payment created with:
  - is_verified = false
  - verified_by = NULL
  - verified_at = NULL
  - payment_status = 'unpaid'
  ↓
Guest pays later
  ↓
Payment status updated to 'paid'
  ↓
Auto-verified or manually verified
```

- ✅ `departments` table: `can_access_tenant(tenant_id)`
- ✅ `terminals` table: `can_access_tenant(tenant_id)`
- ✅ `payments` table: Existing RLS maintained

### **Audit Trail:**
- ✅ Every payment verification logged
- ✅ Department/terminal tracked
- ✅ Staff member recorded
- ✅ Timestamps captured

### **Data Integrity:**
- ✅ Check constraints on payment_status
- ✅ Check constraints on payment_source
- ✅ Foreign key constraints on all relationships

## 🎓 Best Practices for Using Phase 2

### **When Recording Payments:**

1. **Always specify department and terminal** when possible:
```typescript
await processPayment({
  folioId: 'folio-uuid',
  grossAmount: 35250.00,
  paymentMethodId: 'pos-method-uuid',
  tenantId: 'tenant-uuid',
  userId: 'user-uuid',
  departmentId: 'frontdesk-dept-uuid',  // ✅ Specify
  terminalId: 'pos-fd-01-uuid',         // ✅ Specify
  paymentSource: 'frontdesk'            // ✅ Specify
});
```

2. **Rely on defaults for quick transactions:**
```typescript
await processPayment({
  folioId: 'folio-uuid',
  grossAmount: 35250.00,
  paymentMethodId: 'cash-method-uuid',
  tenantId: 'tenant-uuid',
  userId: 'user-uuid'
  // department/terminal will default to FRONTDESK/POS-FD-01
});
```

3. **Use correct payment_source for revenue tracking:**
- `'frontdesk'` - Room bookings, check-ins, general payments
- `'restaurant'` - Restaurant orders
- `'bar'` - Bar orders
- `'gym'` - Gym membership, personal training
- `'spa'` - Spa treatments
- `'laundry'` - Laundry services
- `'other'` - Miscellaneous
